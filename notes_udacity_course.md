These are notes from the deep learning course on udadcity

#Preprocessing notes

-Make sure the data has 0 mean
-Make sure the data has a standard deviation of ~0.5
-Randomize the labels before training so they don't become batches of the same label
 .bad randomization can lead to all sort of problems
-Pay attention for how many overlaps there are in the data (same sample in different sets)
 .depending on the application, it can mess up with the classifier
